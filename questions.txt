1. Are we only looking at *.prt files?
2. Will the Z:\Release, Z:\Review and Z:\In-Process be the only top level directory that we are interested in (i.e. use for categorization)?
3. If yes, can each TLD can have nested directories or just files?
4. If 2 is "No", can this kind of file "Z:\some_other_dir\Release\some_file.prt" exists? If yes, will that be part of Release category?
